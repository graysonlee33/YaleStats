# Instructions
DO NOT RUN THE lines of code creating the table if you already imported the YaleAdmits csv file to your MySQL. Some of the syntax will be messed up in that scenario.
Import the YaleAdmits CSV file into your MySQL server, run each commented section to analyze and identify specific trends in the Yale Admissions Cycle.
